book-catalogue
==============

A list of the books I own. 

The `canonical` CSV is an export from my catalogue on the android app [Book Catalogue](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.eleybourn.bookcatalogue&hl=en)

The `libraryThing` CSV is an export from my [LibraryThing](https://www.librarything.com/catalog/tripofmice) catalogue, which stores the same books with their data and the tags I've added on that site.
