book-catalogue
==============

A list of the books I own. 

The `canonical` CSV is an export from my catalogue on the android app [Book Catalogue](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.eleybourn.bookcatalogue&hl=en)

The `librarything` JSON is an export from my [LibraryThing](https://www.librarything.com/catalog/tripofmice) catalogue, which stores (in theory) the same books as `canonical`, but with LT's data and the tags I've added through the site. 

The `goodreads` CSV is an export of my GoodReads data, which is the only place that stores the date I started a book and the date I finished it.
