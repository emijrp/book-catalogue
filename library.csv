The London that comes to life in Kraken is a weird metropolis awash in secret currents of myth and magic, where criminals, police, cultists, and wizards are locked in a war to bring about—or prevent—the End of All Things.<br><br>In the Darwin Centre at London’s Natural History Museum, Billy Harrow, a cephalopod specialist, is conducting a tour whose climax is meant to be the Centre’s prize specimen of a rare Architeuthis dux<em>—</em>better known as the Giant Squid. But Billy’s tour takes an unexpected turn when the squid suddenly and impossibly vanishes into thin air.<br><br>As Billy soon discovers, this is the precipitating act in a struggle to the death between mysterious but powerful forces in a London whose existence he has been blissfully ignorant of until now, a city whose denizens—human and otherwise—are adept in magic and murder.<br><br>There is the Congregation of God Kraken, a sect of squid worshippers whose roots go back to the dawn of humanity—and beyond. There is the criminal mastermind known as the Tattoo, a merciless maniac inked onto the flesh of a hapless victim. There is the FSRC—the Fundamentalist and Sect-Related Crime Unit—a branch of London’s finest that fights sorcery <strong>\n  <br></strong><br>with sorcery. There is Wati, a spirit from ancient Egypt who leads a ragtag union of magical familiars. There are the Londonmancers, who read the future in the city’s entrails. There is Grisamentum, London’s greatest wizard, whose shadow lingers long after his death. And then there is Goss and Subby, an ageless old man and a cretinous boy who, together, constitute a terrifying—yet darkly charismatic—demonic duo.<br><br>All of them—and others—are in pursuit of Billy, who inadvertently holds the key to the missing squid, an embryonic god whose powers, properly harnessed, can destroy all that is, was, and ever shall be.<br> <br><br><br><em>From the Hardcover edition.</em>","Fiction / Fantasy / Epic","English","2014-01-21 19:02:06","9516288","2014-09-27 04:21:04","2014-09-14 22:53:14","0b1593b4f1ce5c059f51d9e8d4ba9284",

Here is the continuation of her fascinating story. In 1984, Marjane flees fundamentalism and the war with Iraq to begin a new life in Vienna.

Her difficult homecoming forces her to confront the changes both she and her country have undergone in her absence and her shame at what she perceives as her failure in Austria. Marjane allows her past to weigh heavily on her until she finds some like-minded friends, falls in love, and begins studying art at a university. However, the repression and state-sanctioned chauvinism eventually lead her to question whether she can have a future in Iran.<br><br>As funny and poignant as its predecessor, <i>Persepolis 2</i> is another clear-eyed and searing condemnation of the human cost of fundamentalism.

Guthman takes issue with the currently touted remedy to obesity--promoting food that is local, organic, and farm fresh. While such fare may be tastier and grown in more ecologically sustainable ways, this approach can also reinforce class and race inequalities and neglect other possible explanations for the rise in obesity, including environmental toxins.

In <em>Grimoires: A History of Magic Books</em>, Owen Davies illuminates the many fascinating forms these recondite books have taken and exactly what these books held. At their most benign, these repositories of forbidden knowledge revealed how to make powerful talismans and protective amulets, and provided charms and conjurations for healing illness, finding love, and warding off evil. But other books promised the power to control innocent victims, even to call up the devil. Davies traces the history of this remarkably resilient and adaptable genre, from the ancient Middle East to modern America, offering a new perspective on the fundamental developments of western civilization over the past two thousand years. <em>Grimoires</em> shows the influence magic and magical writing has had on the  cultures of the world, richly demonstrating the role they have played in the spread of Christianity, the growth of literacy, and the influence of western traditions from colonial times to the present.","Social Science / Folklore & Mythology","English","2014-01-21 19:19:31","6146412","2014-09-27 04:29:20","2014-09-14 22:55:36","c3534004cd4817327dd55e3d9a40c144",

Everything about the history of the Society of Jesus bespoke deft and efficient action, exploration and research. During what Europeans were pleased to call the Age of Discovery, Jesuit priests were never more than a year or two behind the men who made initial contact with previously unknown peoples; indeed, Jesuits were often the vanguard of exploration.<br><br>The United Nations required years to come to a decision that the Society of Jesus reached in ten days. In New York, diplomats debated long and hard, with many recesses and tablings of the issue, whether and why human resources should be expended in an attempt to contact the world that would become known as Rakhat when there were so many pressing needs on Earth. In Rome, the questions were not whether or why but how soon the mission could be attempted and whom to send.<br><br>The Society asked leave of no temporal government. It acted on its own principles, with its own assets, on Papal authority. The mission to Rakhat was undertaken not so much secretly as privately – a fine distinction but one that the Society felt no compulsion to explain or justify when the news broke several years later.<br><br>The Jesuit scientists went to learn, not to proselytize. They went so that they might come to know and love God’s other children. They went for the reason Jesuits have always gone to the furthest frontiers of human exploration.

It vividly portrays the experience of growing up in a Nuer community, describing daily life, marriage, sex, death, and birth. It also makes clear the essential difference between the discourse of political association and that of kinship, and shows the part played by the kinship system in Nuer society as a whole.

By living among the people he studied there, speaking their language and participating in their activities, he invented what became known as 'participant-observation'. This new type of ethnographic study was to have a huge impact on the emerging discipline of anthropology. In <EM>Sex and Repression in Savage Society</EM> Malinowski applied his experiences on the Trobriand Islands to the study of sexuality, and the attendant issues of eroticism, obscenity, incest, oppression, power and parenthood. In so doing, he both utilized and challenged the psychoanalytical methods being popularized at the time in Europe by Freud and others. The result is a unique and brilliant book that, though revolutionary when first published, has since become a standard work on the psychology of sex.","Social Science / Sociology / General","English","2014-01-21 19:27:45","1237076","2014-09-27 04:30:53","2014-09-14 22:56:27","2a43374d9a5257eb8dd180427b2f8fbf",

Called a madman by his enemies, a genius by others, and an enigma by nearly everyone, Nikola Tesla was, without a doubt, a trailblazing inventor who created astonishing, sometimes world-transforming devices that were virtually without theoretical precedent. Tesla not only discovered the rotating magnetic field -- the basis of most alternating-current machinery -- but also introduced us to the fundamentals of robotics, computers, and missile science. Almost supernaturally gifted, unfailingly flamboyant and neurotic, Tesla was troubled by an array of compulsions and phobias and was fond of extravagant, visionary experimentations. He was also a popular man-about-town, admired by men as diverse as Mark Twain and George Westinghouse, and adored by scores of society beauties. <br> From Tesla's childhood in Yugoslavia to his death in New York in the 1940s, Cheney paints a compelling human portrait and chronicles a lifetime of discoveries that radically altered -- and continue to alter -- the world in which we live. <em>Tesla: Man Out of Time</em> is an in-depth look at the seminal accomplishments of a scientific wizard and a thoughtful examination of the obsessions and eccentricities of the man behind the science.","Science / General","English","2014-01-21 19:31:02","128529","2014-09-27 04:32:27","2014-09-14 22:56:56","ade3ad17349eb4d97475fff68ea97320",

This pattern—the city in the center, the airport on the periphery— shaped life in the twentieth century, from the central city to exurban sprawl. Today, the ubiquity of jet travel, round-the-clock workdays, overnight shipping, and global business networks has turned the pattern inside out. Soon the airport will be at the center and the city will be built around it, the better to keep workers, suppliers, executives, and goods in touch with the global market. <br><br>This is the aerotropolis: a combination of giant airport, planned city, shipping facility, and business hub. The aerotropolis approach to urban living is now reshaping life in Seoul and Amsterdam, in China and India, in Dallas and Washington, D.C. The aerotropolis is the frontier of the next phase of globalization, whether we like it or not. <br><br>John D. Kasarda defined the term “aerotropolis,” and he is now sought after worldwide as an adviser. Working with Kasarda’s ideas and research, the gifted journalist Greg Lindsay gives us a vivid, at times disquieting look at these instant cities in the making, the challenges they present to our environment and our usual ways of life, and the opportunities they offer to those who can exploit them creatively. <em>Aerotropolis </em>is news from the near future—news we urgently need if we are to understand the changing world and our place in it.","Transportation / Aviation / General","English","2014-01-21 19:33:08","8966446","2014-09-27 04:32:50","2014-09-14 22:57:06","67f459b53e3433f107ec1e0ff9199ff7",

From Abramelin he took his concepts of protections, purifications, evocations, vestments, and dromena down to specific details. This system of Abramelin the Mage is known from a unique 15th century manuscript persevered in the Bibliotheque de l`Arsenal in Paris. In it, Abraham of Wurzburg, a cabalist and connoisseur of magics, describes a tour that he made of the then civilized world, visiting sorcerers, magicians, and cabalists, estimating their powers and virtues.

The high point of Abraham`s travels was found in a small town on the banks of the Nile, where he encountered the great magician Abramelin, whose complete system Abraham thereupon sets out in detail.

Max Brooks, driven by the urgency of preserving the acid-etched first-hand experiences of the survivors from those apocalyptic years, traveled across the United States of America and throughout the world, from decimated cities that once teemed with upwards of thirty million souls to the most remote and inhospitable areas of the planet. He recorded the testimony of men, women, and sometimes children who came face-to-face with the living, or at least the undead, hell of that dreadful time. ""World War Z"" is the result. Never before have we had access to a document that so powerfully conveys the depth of fear and horror, and also the ineradicable spirit of resistance, that gripped human society through the plague years. <br><br> Ranging from the now infamous village of New Dachang in the United Federation of China, where the epidemiological trail began with the twelve-year-old Patient Zero, to the unnamed northern forests where untold numbers sought a terrible and temporary refuge in the cold, to the United States of Southern Africa, where the Redeker Plan provided hope for humanity at an unspeakable price, to the west-of-the-Rockies redoubt where the North American tide finally started to turn, this invaluable chronicle reflects the full scope and duration of the Zombie War. <br><br> Most of all, the book captures with haunting immediacy the human dimension of this epochal event. Facing the often raw and vivid nature of these personal accounts requires a degree of courage on the part of the reader, but the effort is invaluable because, as Mr. Brooks says in his introduction, ""By excluding the human factor, aren't we risking the kind of personal detachment from history that may, heaven forbid, lead us one day to repeat it? And in the end, isn't the human factor the only true difference between us and the enemy we now refer to as 'the living dead'?"" <br><br> Note: Some of the numerical and factual material contained in this edition was previously published under the auspices of the United Nations Postwar Commission.

He was writhing like an animal; a gag muffled his growls. At first the villagers tried to hold me back. They warned me not to touch him, that he was 'cursed.' I shrugged them off and reached for my mask and gloves. The boy's skin was . . . cold and gray . . .

He writes, ""There are almost no characters in this story, and almost no dramatic confrontations, because most of the people in it are so sick, and so much the listless playthings of enormous forces. One of the main effects of war, after all, is that people are discouraged from being characters.""<br><br><em>Slaughterhouse-Five</em> is not only Vonnegut's most powerful book, it is also as important as any written since 1945. Like <em>Catch- 22</em>, it fashions the author's experiences in the Second World War into an eloquent and deeply funny plea against butchery in the service of authority. <em>Slaughterhouse-Five</em> boasts the same imagination, humanity, and gleeful appreciation of the absurd found in Vonnegut's other works, but the book's basis in rock-hard, tragic fact gives it a unique poignancy - and humor.","Fiction / Science Fiction / General","English","2014-01-21 19:37:33","4981","2014-09-27 04:34:15","2014-09-14 22:57:44","e833c9bb68547d286701b7e258bb59f2",

Our 1940s heroes are the brilliant mathematician Lawrence Waterhouse, crypt analyst extraordinaire, and gung-ho, morphine-addicted marine Bobby Shaftoe. They're part of Detachment 2702, an Allied group trying to break Axis communication codes while simultaneously preventing the enemy from figuring out that their codes have been broken. Their job boils down to layer upon layer of deception. Dr. Alan Turing is also a member of 2702, and he explains the unit's strange workings to Waterhouse. ""When we want to sink a convoy, we send out an observation plane first... Of course, to observe is not its real duty--we already know exactly where the convoy is. Its real duty is to be observed... Then, when we come round and sink them, the Germans will not find it suspicious.""<br><br>All of this secrecy resonates in the present-day story line, in which the grandchildren of the WWII heroes--inimitable programming geek Randy Waterhouse and the lovely and powerful Amy Shaftoe--team up to help create an offshore data haven in Southeast Asia and maybe uncover some gold once destined for Nazi coffers. To top off the paranoiac tone of the book, the mysterious Enoch Root, key member of Detachment 2702 and the Societas Eruditorum, pops up with an unbreakable encryption scheme left over from WWII to befuddle the 1990s protagonists with conspiratorial ties.","Fiction / Thrillers / General","English","2014-01-21 19:37:59","816","2014-09-27 04:34:31","2014-09-14 22:57:49","fbdcba500105c21557ebfc5278e14357",

A middle-aged man returns to his childhood home to attend a funeral. Although the house he lived in is long gone, he is drawn to the farm at the end of the road, where, when he was seven, he encountered a most remarkable girl, Lettie Hempstock, and her mother and grandmother. He hasn't thought of Lettie in decades, and yet as he sits by the pond (a pond that she'd claimed was an ocean) behind the ramshackle old farmhouse, the unremembered past comes flooding back. And it is a past too strange, too frightening, too dangerous to have happened to anyone, let alone a small boy.<br><br>Forty years earlier, a man committed suicide in a stolen car at this farm at the end of the road. Like a fuse on a firework, his death lit a touchpaper and resonated in unimaginable ways. The darkness was unleashed, something scary and thoroughly incomprehensible to a little boy. And Lettie—magical, comforting, wise beyond her years—promised to protect him, no matter what.<br><br>A groundbreaking work from a master, <em>The Ocean at the End of the Lane</em> is told with a rare understanding of all that makes us human, and shows the power of stories to reveal and shelter us from the darkness inside and out.

Tolkien's imaginative writing, a work whose origins stretch back to a time long before <em>The Hobbit</em>.<br><br>Tolkien considered <em>The Silmarillion</em> his most important work, and, though it was published last and posthumously, this great collection of tales and legends clearly sets the stage for all his other writing. The story of the creation of the world and of the First Age, this is the ancient drama to which the characters in <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> look back and in whose events some of them, such as Elrond and Galadriel, took part. The three Silmarils were jewels created by Feanor, most gifted of the Elves. Within them was imprisoned the Light of the Two Trees of Valinor before the Trees themselves were destroyed by Morgoth, the first Dark Lord. Thereafter, the unsullied Light of Valinor live on only in the Silmarils, but they were seized by Morgoth and set in his crown, which was guarded in the impenetrable fortress of Angband in the north of Middle-earth. <em>The Silmarillion</em> is the history of the rebellion of Feanor and his kindred against the gods, their exile from Valinor and return to Middle-earth, and their war, hopeless despite all their heroism, against the great Enemy.<br><br>This second edition features a letter written by J.R.R. Tolkein describing his intentions for the book, which serves as a brilliant exposition of his conception of the earlier Ages of Middle-earth.","Fiction / Fantasy / Epic","English","2014-01-21 22:49:30","259055","2014-09-27 04:37:54","2014-09-14 22:58:51","b7d8a8c3299b16db7ba6ba2b83b40603",

Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort.""</em>  The hobbit-hole in question belongs to one Bilbo Baggins, an upstanding member of a ""little people, about half our height, and smaller than the bearded dwarves."" He is, like most of his kind, well off, well fed, and best pleased when sitting by his own fire with a pipe, a glass of good beer, and a meal to look forward to. Certainly this particular hobbit is the last person one would expect to see set off on a hazardous journey; indeed, when Gandalf the Grey stops by one morning, ""looking for someone to share in an adventure,"" Baggins fervently wishes the wizard elsewhere. No such luck, however; soon 13 fortune-seeking dwarves have arrived on the hobbit's doorstep in search of a burglar, and before he can even grab his hat or an umbrella, Bilbo Baggins is swept out his door and into a dangerous adventure.<p>  The dwarves' goal is to return to their ancestral home in the Lonely Mountains and reclaim a stolen fortune from the dragon Smaug. Along the way, they and their reluctant companion meet giant spiders, hostile elves, ravening wolves--and, most perilous of all, a subterranean creature named Gollum from whom Bilbo wins a magical ring in a riddling contest. It is from this life-or-death game in the dark that J.R.R. Tolkien's masterwork,  <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, would eventually spring. Though <em>The Hobbit</em> is lighter in tone than the trilogy that follows, it has, like Bilbo Baggins himself, unexpected iron at its core. Don't be fooled by its fairy-tale demeanor; this is very much a story for adults, though older children will enjoy it, too. By the time Bilbo returns to his comfortable hobbit-hole, he is a different person altogether, well primed for the bigger adventures to come--and so is the reader. <em>--Alix Wilber</em></p>","","English","2014-01-21 22:50:07","554286","2014-09-27 04:38:03","2014-09-14 22:58:55","521ccea301e1a80db7d3245c044bf649",

Pratchett returns to his first Discworld protagonist, the inept and cowardly wizard Rincewind, who habitually runs into trouble as fast as he flees. Rincewind's arrival in Fourecks has distorted the space-time continuum, and he has to sort it out before the whole place dries up and blows away. The situation is complicated because the actual problem is located 30,000 years in the past--just where the Faculty of the Unseen University currently are. Pretty frightening, given ""the true wizard's instinct to amble aimlessly into dangerous places,"" and then ""stop and argue ... about exactly what kind of danger it [is].""<br><br>If you're baffled by all this, no worries, mate. You needn't have read Pratchett before--not even the five previous Discworld novels starring Rincewind (The Colour of Magic, The Light Fantastic, Sourcery, Eric, and Interesting Times)--to enjoy this latest romp.

Here we encounter ""The Lost Mariner,"" who has lost his memory &amp; with it the greater part of his personal history; patients who are convulsed by epileptic memories from the past; patients with remarkable perceptual &amp; intellectual aberrations—like ""The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat""; others with extraordinary perceptual amplifications &amp; gifts. We encounter patients who are galvanized by incessant tics, imitations, explosions of passion &amp; imagery. We encounter patients who feel partly or wholly disembodied, others who feel phantom limbs or bodies. We encounter every sort of excess &amp; defect, every sort of aberration &amp; transformation—patients who become, briefly, under the spur of neurological disorder, flirts, visionaries, murderers or dogs. These tales aren't simply studies of disease but of life itself struggling against extraordinary adversity. This exploration is always leavened by a deep human sympathy, so that these men &amp; women, however strangely afflicted, are felt as intensely human. Sacks enables us to enter their strange situations &amp; imagine with the heart, if no with the mind, what it must be to live &amp; feel as they do.<br>Implicit in these tales is a plea for a deeper &amp; more humane science. These tales themselves are exemplars of such a science.","Science / General","English","2014-01-21 23:02:52","748725","2014-09-27 04:43:43","2014-09-14 23:00:34","7f572c6b0dff7508fc4089602b6fbe38",

(It's in two separate collections, both worth owning, <em>Barrel Fever</em> and the Christmas-themed <em>Holidays on Ice</em>.) Sedaris's caustic gift has not deserted him in his fourth book, which mines poignant comedy from his peculiar childhood in North Carolina, his bizarre career path, and his move with his lover to France. Though his anarchic inclination to digress is his glory, Sedaris does have a theme in these reminiscences: the inability of humans to communicate. The title is his rendition in transliterated English of how he and his fellow students of French in Paris mangle the Gallic language. In the essay ""Jesus Shaves,"" he and his classmates from many nations try to convey the concept of Easter to a Moroccan Muslim. ""It is a party for the little boy of God,"" says one. ""Then he be die one day on two... morsels of... lumber,"" says another. Sedaris muses on the disputes between his Protestant mother and his father, a Greek Orthodox guy whose Easter fell on a different day. Other essays explicate his deep kinship with his eccentric mom and absurd alienation from his IBM-exec dad: ""To me, the greatest mystery of science continues to be that a man could father six children who shared absolutely none of his interests."" <p>  Every glimpse we get of Sedaris's family and acquaintances delivers laughs and insights. He thwarts his North Carolina speech therapist (""for whom the word <em>pen</em> had two syllables"") by cleverly avoiding all words with <em>s</em> sounds, which reveal the lisp she sought to correct. His midget guitar teacher, Mister Mancini, is unaware that Sedaris doesn't share his obsession with breasts, and sings ""Light My Fire"" all wrong--""as if he were a Webelo scout demanding a match."" As a remarkably unqualified teacher at the Art Institute of Chicago, Sedaris had his class watch soap operas and assign ""guessays"" on what would happen in the next day's episode. </p><p>  It all adds up to the most distinctively skewed autobiography since Spalding Gray's <em>Swimming to Cambodia</em>. The only possible reason not to read this book is if you'd rather hear the author's intrinsically funny speaking voice narrating his story. In that case, get <em>Me Talk Pretty One Day</em> on audio. <em>--Tim Appelo</em></p>","Humor / Form / Essays","English","2014-01-21 23:03:26","482978","2014-09-27 04:43:59","2014-09-14 23:00:39","ee38b2ef9f1cb18c396f8e8e57b1b956",

She explores the area thematically—connecting, for example, Eadweard Muybridge’s foundation of motion-picture technology with Alfred Hitchcock’s filming of <em>Vertigo.</em> Across an urban grid of just seven by seven miles, she finds seemingly unlimited landmarks and treasures—butterfly habitats, queer sites, murders, World War II shipyards, blues clubs, Zen Buddhist centers. She roams the political terrain, both progressive and conservative, and details the cultural geographies of the Mission District, the culture wars of the Fillmore, the South of Market world being devoured by redevelopment, and much, much more.

While Gustave Eiffel was changing the skyline of Paris, large parts of France were still terra incognita. Even in the age of railways and newspapers, France was a land of ancient tribal divisions, prehistoric communication networks, and pre-Christian beliefs. French itself was a minority language.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Graham Robb describes that unknown world in arresting narrative detail. He recounts the epic journeys of mapmakers, scientists, soldiers, administrators, and intrepid tourists, of itinerant workers, pilgrims, and herdsmen with their millions of migratory domestic animals. We learn how France was explored, charted, and colonized, and how the imperial influence of Paris was gradually extended throughout a kingdom of isolated towns and villages.<br><br><br><br><br><br><em>The Discovery of France</em> explains how the modern nation came to be and how poorly understood that nation still is today. Above all, it shows how much of France—past and present—remains to be discovered.

Lately, an influential dwarf, Grag Hamcrusher, has been fomenting unrest among Ankh-Morpork's more diminutive citizens with incendiary speeches.

She recounts her own decisions, mistakes, and daily struggles to make the right choices for herself, her career, and her family. She provides practical advice on negotiation techniques, mentorship, and building a satisfying career, urging women to set boundaries and to abandon the myth of “having it all.”  She describes specific steps women can take to combine professional achievement with personal fulfillment and demonstrates how men can benefit by supporting women in the workplace and at home. <br><br> Written with both humor and wisdom<em>,</em> Sandberg’s book is an inspiring call to action and a blueprint for individual growth. <em>Lean In</em> is destined to change the conversation from what women can’t do to what they can.","Self-Help / Personal Growth / Success","English","2014-01-21 23:14:07","16071764","2014-09-27 04:49:32","2014-09-14 23:02:30","3001ac978cefe451deb9ec75a0b896f3",

It was a mystery for thousands of years, long thought to be an icy Eden, a place of exquisite beauty and unequaled purity. The lost world of Thule captured the imagination of poets, artists, explorers, and, most recently, writer Joanna Kavenna, who set out on a harrowing and exhilarating voyage of discovery. Her journey took her to Shetland, Iceland, Norway, Estonia, Greenland, and Svalbard-into the Arctic wilderness, over frozen seas and ice mountains-in search of this most haunting of northern places. <p> As she travels, Kavenna finds traces of earlier writers and seekers: Richard Francis Burton, William Morris, Anthony Trollope, and Norwegian explorer Fridtjof Nansen. But she comes to discover that a darkness also inhabits Thule. She finds ice-bound relics of the cold war. She unearths the story of the Thule Society, an offshoot of the Nazi party, devoted to the ""purity"" of the Nordic peoples.

A Red Army officer forments a rebellion of the native Martians, who are in fact long-ago emigrants from Atlantis. The story was adapted into a screen play in 1924. Its futuristic, expressionistic sets were designed by Isaac Rabinovitch of the Kamerny Theatre. The film influenced the design in Flash Gordon, a space opera, which was created by the artist Alex Raymond in 1934 and led to a popular radio serial and several films.

The Dadant family, originally from France, is one the first families of beekeeping in America. Charles Dadant (1817-1902) is considered one of the founding fathers of modern beekeeping. He was always seeking a better way to keep bees. Just as he had begun with the old European ""eke"", he quickly abandoned that kind of beekeeping for the modern Langstroth hive concept. Bee hives have often been designed and built without regard for the needs and habits of the honey bee colony. Probably the best design for a colony was the large hive developed by Charles Dadant. It provided a large, deep brood chamber with plenty of room in which the queen could lay, and shallower supers for honey storage. However, the price and promotion of smaller hives offered for sale during the period from about 1885 to 1900 made them more popular. Charles son, Camille Pierre Dadant, authored First Lessons in Beekeeping, a standard and still important work on this subject. Dadant's book and its succeeding editions have been America's first stop for beginning beekeepers for over 90 years.

The credible alternate history that Robinson constructs becomes the framework for a tapestry of ideas about philosophy, science, theology, and politics. <p> At the heart of the story are fundamental questions: what is the purpose of life and death?

Conjuration for the Book, Grimoire of Pope Honorius The Grimoire of Pope Honorius is the first and most important of the French 'black magic' grimoires which proliferated across Europe in the 17th-19th centuries. Combining a grimoire of conjurations to demons of the four directions and seven days of the week with a Book of Secrets full of simple charms, the Grimoire of Pope Honorius was second only to the Key of Solomon in the influence it exerted on magicians, charmers and cunning-folk in both rural and urban France. This grimoire also played a role in social events which rocked France, being used in the Affair of the Poisons which scandalised the French royal court in 1679, and by the young priest who assassinated the archbishop of Paris in 1857. The Complete Grimoire of Pope Honorius contains material translated from all four of the different French editions of the Grimoire of Pope Honorius, including the complete text of one manuscript version never before seen in English (Wellcome 4666), and a new translation of the later corrupted German version of 1845. All of the material and its variations found in the five different editions of the Grimoire of Pope Honorius is contained in this work, presenting the entire corpus of this grimoire in print for the first time. In addition to tracing much of the material to sources such as the Heptameron, the works of Agrippa and earlier religious texts for the first time, the derivation of much of the material into later grimoires including the Grimorium Verum, the Grand Grimoire/Red Dragon and the Black Dragon is clearly demonstrated. As well as charms for health, wealth, sex and protection, the Grimoire of Pope Honorius also contains a substantial number of agrarian charms by the Norman magician Guidon for protecting livestock, emphasising the popular rural use of such charms until at least the 19th century. The corpus of charms comes from diverse sources, including Scot's Discoverie of Witchcraft (1584), and some like the Letter of St Anthony can be dated back to at least the 13th century. Including numerous illustrations, and tables tracing the derivation of the material through the different editions and into other grimoires, the Complete Grimoire of Pope Honorius demonstrates the versatility and significance of this grimoire, cutting past outdated misperceptions to a viewpoint which reflects more accurately the position of the Grimoire of Pope Honorius in the development of magic since the seventeenth century.","Body, Mind & Spirit / Occultism","English","2014-02-13 16:21:55","18288069","2014-09-27 04:59:05","2014-09-14 23:05:36","761207628ca2a16a81c78b50e00ef652",

Its form, the cartoon (the Nazis are cats, the Jews mice), shocks us out of any lingering sense of familiarity and succeeds in “drawing us closer to the bleak heart of the Holocaust” (<em>The New York Times</em>).<br><br><em>Maus </em>is a haunting tale within a tale. Vladek’s harrowing story of survival is woven into the author’s account of his tortured relationship with his aging father. Against the backdrop of guilt brought by survival, they stage a normal life of small arguments and unhappy visits. This astonishing retelling of our century’s grisliest news is a story of survival, not only of Vladek but of the children who survive even the survivors. <em>Maus </em>studies the bloody pawprints of history and tracks its meaning for all of us.","","English","2014-02-13 16:23:16","331692","2014-09-27 04:59:26","2014-09-14 23:05:45","55005c7a48649f92a407d487f84383d3",

Margaret Atwood's chilling new novel <em>Oryx and Crake</em> moves beyond the futuristic fantasy of her 1985 bestseller <em>The Handmaid's Tale</em> to an even more dystopian world, a world where language--and with it anything beyond the merest semblance of humanity--has almost entirely vanished. <p> Snowman may be the last man on earth, the only survivor of an unnamed apocalypse. Once he was Jimmy, a member of a scientific elite; now he lives in bitter isolation and loneliness, his only pleasure the watching of old films on DVD. His mind moves backwards and forwards through time, from an agonising trawl through memory to relive the events that led up to sudden catastrophe (most significantly the disappearance of his mother and the arrival of his mysterious childhood companions Oryx and Crake, symbols of the fractured society in which Snowman now finds himself, to the horrifying present of genetic engineering run amok. His only witnesses, eager to lap up his testimony, are ""Crakers"", laboratory creatures of varying strengths and abilities, who can offer little comfort. Gradually the reasons behind the disaster begin to unfold as Snowman undertakes a perilous journey to the remains of the bubble-dome complex where the sinister Paradice Project collapsed and near-global devastation began. </p><p> This, Atwood's 11th novel, confirms her as one of our most contemporary novelists. Darkly humorous and icily prescient, <em>Oryx and Crake</em> shows a writer deeply concerned with the stark moral issues facing the human race, and accords a glimpse of a future that lies all too uneasily within reach. --<em>Catherine Taylor</em></p>","","English","2014-02-13 16:30:55","48262","2014-09-27 05:00:42","2014-09-14 23:05:58","e0013281c4eab695d34b26be29948b6d",

But by the early 1800s they have long since lost the ability to perform magic. They can only write long, dull papers about it, while fairy servants are nothing but a fading memory.<br><br>But at Hurtfew Abbey in Yorkshire, the rich, reclusive Mr Norrell has assembled a wonderful library of lost and forgotten books from England's magical past and regained some of the powers of England's magicians. He goes to London and raises a beautiful young woman from the dead. Soon he is lending his help to the government in the war against Napoleon Bonaparte, creating ghostly fleets of rain-ships to confuse and alarm the French.<br><br>All goes well until a rival magician appears. Jonathan Strange is handsome, charming, and talkative-the very opposite of Mr Norrell. Strange thinks nothing of enduring the rigors of campaigning with Wellington's army and doing magic on battlefields. Astonished to find another practicing magician, Mr Norrell accepts Strange as a pupil. But it soon becomes clear that their ideas of what English magic ought to be are very different. For Mr Norrell, their power is something to be cautiously controlled, while Jonathan Strange will always be attracted to the wildest, most perilous forms of magic. He becomes fascinated by the ancient, shadowy figure of the Raven King, a child taken by fairies who became king of both England and Faerie, and the most legendary magician of all. Eventually Strange's heedless pursuit of long-forgotten magic threatens to destroy not only his partnership with Norrell, but everything that he holds dear.<br><br>Sophisticated, witty, and ingeniously convincing, Susanna Clarke's magisterial novel weaves magic into a flawlessly detailed vision of historical England.

The sensationalistic trial made headlines throughout the world, and the jury delivered a guilty verdict.

Gaiman tackles everything from the onslaught of the information age to the meaning of death, but he doesn't sacrifice the razor-sharp plotting and narrative style he's been delivering since his Sandman days.<br><br>Shadow gets out of prison early when his wife is killed in a car crash. At a loss, he takes up with a mysterious character called Wednesday, who is much more than he appears. In fact, Wednesday is an old god, once known as Odin the All-father, who is roaming America rounding up his forgotten fellows in preparation for an epic battle against the upstart deities of the Internet, credit cards, television, and all that is wired. Shadow agrees to help Wednesday, and they whirl through a psycho-spiritual storm that becomes all too real in its manifestations. For instance, Shadow's dead wife Laura keeps showing up, and not just as a ghost – the difficulty of their continuing relationship is by turns grim and darkly funny, just like the rest of the book.<br><br>Armed only with some coin tricks and a sense of purpose, Shadow travels through, around, and underneath the visible surface of things, digging up all the powerful myths Americans brought with them in their journeys to this land as well as the ones that were already here. Shadow's road story is the heart of the novel, and it's here that Gaiman offers up the details that make this such a cinematic book--the distinctly American foods and diversions, the bizarre roadside attractions, the decrepit gods reduced to shell games and prostitution. ""This is a bad land for Gods,"" says Shadow.<br><br>More than a tourist in America, but not a native, Neil Gaiman offers an outside-in and inside-out perspective on the soul and spirituality of the country--our obsessions with money and power, our jumbled religious heritage and its societal outcomes, and the millennial decisions we face about what's real and what's not. <em>--Therese Littleton</em>","Fiction / Fantasy / General","English","2014-02-23 00:36:58","983100","2014-09-27 05:04:01","2014-09-14 23:07:06","1b57cebcbfee95cd04daf3754b36cad6",

This initial volume collects the first two years of stories from Dave Sim's 300-issue magnum opus (still in progress after 20 years). Don't be discouraged by the initially crude artwork or the silliness of the stories. It gets better--even noticeably within this volume. This first installment is the most valuable in preparing for the larger stories ahead.<br><br>When we first meet Cerebus--a small, gray, and chronically ill-tempered aardvark--he is making his living as a barbarian. In 1977, when the Cerebus comic book series began, Sim initially conceived of it as a parody of such popular series as Conan, Red Sonja, and Elric but quickly mined that material and transformed the scope of the series into much more. Even by the end of this volume, the Cerebus story begins to transform beyond ""funny animal"" humor into something much more complex and interesting.<p> High points in <em>Cerebus</em> include the introduction of Lord Julius, the dictator of Palnu, who looks, acts, and talks just like a certain cigar-smoking, mustachioed comedian; Jaka, Cerebus's one true love; Elrod the Albino, an innept swordsman; and the Cockroach, the-mother-of-all-superhero-parodies and ""inspiration"" for the much-later TV and comic character--the Tick. All of these characters appear later on in the series as part of a constantly present ensemble of supporting figures.<br><br>Even if <em>Cerebus</em> doesn't knock your socks off, give its successor, <em>High Society</em> a try, as this is where the plot really gets going.</p>","Comics & Graphic Novels / Fantasy","English","2014-02-28 16:20:43","198462","2014-09-27 05:07:16","2014-09-14 23:07:40","88f132c661d9bca4bd2feb46f71e8a78",

Unlike the vast majority of writings, it is clear, concise, and elegantly written. The practical instructions are straightforward and undemanding. When it first appeared in 1575, it attracted the attention of people with a surprisingly broad range of agendas, including some of the finest minds of the time. Often quoted and reprinted, both praised and condemned, its impact on western esoteric philosophy has been called ""overwhelming."" Arbatel's magic is full of wonder and free from the sinister elements usually associated with texts on the subject. But it is about more than magic; filled with gnomic wisdom, it urges us to help our neighbors, be positive and grateful, and use time wisely. Above all, it teaches us to pay attention, looking for the wondrous and miraculous. In fact, to the author this virtually defines the magus.

Through vivid interpretation of original source texts, Gareth Knight shows that the Melusine story is a powerful initiatory legend emerging from the deeply transformative Faery Tradition of ancient Europe. Furthermore he demonstrates how such legends manifest as history: the innate sacromagical power of Melusine affected key places and events in the development of the medieval world and from there reached far into the shaping of the modern world through the conflicts for Jerusalem and the Middle East.

Barbara Rosen has gathered and edited a rare collection of documents--pamphlets, reports, trial accounts, and other material--that describes the experience, interpretation, and punishment of witchcraft in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. In her introduction, Rosen explores the full range of practices and beliefs associated with witchcraft and situates these phenomena in historical context. She explains how ignorance of science and medicine combined with social circumstance and religious ideology to shape popular perceptions and superstitions. Distinguishing between English and Continental forms of witchcraft, she also examines the legal definitions, disciplines, and punishments applied to wizards, witches, wise women, and conjurers in the Elizabethan age. The pamphlets and other original texts have been modernized in certain respects to make them more accessible to general readers. But the book retains its value for scholars: omissions are detailed in the notes and additions marked; obsolete words and grammar are explained in the glossary. Originally published in England in 1970 under the title Witchcraft, this book appears now for the first time in paperback and includes a new preface by the editor.","Body, Mind & Spirit / Magick Studies","English","2014-04-14 01:31:47","2423057","2014-09-27 05:13:09","2014-09-14 23:09:27","f3b9059b9707d284759ea09d8be94150",

It was first presented on stage to the public in 1912. Professor of phonetics Henry Higgins makes a bet that he can train a bedraggled Cockney flower girl, Eliza Doolittle, to pass for a duchess at an ambassador's garden party by teaching her to assume a veneer of gentility, the most important element of which, he believes, is impeccable speech. The play is a sharp lampoon of the rigid British class system of the day and a commentary on women's independence. In ancient Greek mythology, Pygmalion fell in love with one of his sculptures, which then came to life. The general idea of that myth was a popular subject for Victorian era English playwrights, including one of Shaw's influences, W. S. Gilbert, who wrote a successful play based on the story called Pygmalion and Galatea first presented in 1871. Shaw also would have been familiar with the burlesque version, Galatea, or Pygmalion Reversed. Shaw's play has been adapted numerous times, most notably as the musical My Fair Lady and the film of that name. Shaw mentioned that the character of Professor Henry Higgins was inspired by several British professors of phonetics: Alexander Melville Bell, Alexander J. Ellis, Tito Pagliardini, but above all, the cantankerous Henry Sweet.","","English","2014-04-20 22:29:27","0","","2014-09-14 23:09:49","6658dfc5f9f48bdd99a878e199071953",

In France, around 1860, from the loins of a traditional national fascination with all things diabolical, was born a new sensation - a series of visionary dioramas depicting life in a strange parallel universe called ENFER - Hell - communicated to an eager audience by means of stereoscopic cards, to be viewed in the stereoscopes which had already become popular in the 1850s. This 3-D phenomenon, which fascinated a nation for 40 years, is now yours to share. This book, the fruit of half a lifetime's study by three impassioned authors, brings every one of the published Diableries into the 21st century for the very first time. Some of them are so rare that at the time of writing there is no known complete collection of the originals of these masterpieces. But this book enables all but two of the 182 scenes to be enjoyed just as their creators intended, in magnificent 3-D, using the high-quality patent OWL stereoscopic viewer supplied.","Photography / Subjects & Themes / Fashion","English","2014-04-23 04:03:53","18350992","2014-09-27 05:17:16","2014-09-14 23:11:22","613a9123ad58ffff8e7170d1b7f537df",

She demonstrates that, far from being an exotic or marginal practice in the modern world, brujeria has become an invisible yet active partner of consumerism and welfare capitalism.","Social Science / Anthropology / Cultural","English","2014-05-25 20:05:11","1497931","2014-09-27 05:23:46","2014-09-14 23:12:44","29e045d59e187e28aece87b54e8172cb",

The masks of preclassical Greece¯in particular those of the Satyr and the Gorgon¯provide his starting point. A comparison of Greek to Eastern and especially Indian models follows, and the book concludes with an examination of the interpretation of Hindu ideas in Bali that demonstrates the importance of ambivalence in mask iconography.","Social Science / Folklore & Mythology","English","2014-05-25 20:07:24","2568928","2014-09-27 05:24:50","2014-09-14 23:13:04","77c2f3b7ef460e7baebe57d39c6f7dca",

For those who have ever wondered if the familiar ""pride of lions"" and ""gaggle of geese"" were only the tip of a linguistic iceberg, James Lipton has provided the definitive answer: here are hundreds of equally pithy, and often poetic, terms unearthed by Mr. Lipton in the Books of Venery that were the constant study of anyone who aspired to the title of gentleman in the fifteenth century. When Mr. Lipton's painstaking research revealed that five hundred years ago the terms of venery had already been turned into the Game of Venery, he embarked on an odyssey that has given us a ""slouch of models,"" a ""shrivel of critics,"" an ""unction of undertakers,"" a ""blur of Impressionists,"" a ""score of bachelors,"" and a ""pocket of quarterbacks."" This ultimate edition of An Exaltation of Larks is Mr. Lipton's brilliant answer to the assault on language and literacy in the last decades of the twentieth century.

Dee concealed his treatises on the nature of humankind's contact with angelic realms and languages throughout his life, and they were nearly lost forever. In his brief biography of John Dee, Joseph Peterson calls him a 'true Renaissance man, ' detailing his work in astronomy, mathematics, navigation, the arts, astrology, and the occult sciences. He was even thought to be the model for Shakespeare's Prospero. All this was preparation for Dee's main achievement: five books, revealed and transcribed between March 1582 and May 1583, bringing to light mysteries and truths that scholars and adepts have been struggling to understand and use ever since. These books detail his system for communicating with the angels, and reveal that the angels were interested in and involved with the exploration and colonization of the New World, and in heralding in a new age or new world order. While Dee's influence was certainly felt in his lifetime, his popularity has grown tremendously since. His system was used and adapted by the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, and subsequently by Aleister Crowley. This new edition of John Dee's Five Books of Mystery is by far the most accessible and complete published to date. Peterson has translated Latin terms and added copious footnotes, putting the instructions and references into context for the modern reader.","Body, Mind & Spirit / Magick Studies","Latin","2014-06-29 19:52:26","0","0000-00-00","2014-09-14 23:14:09","0de7f3d48ce847b53cafcf885e26c7d1",

Fascinated by the inner life of Charles Lutwidge Dodson, Robin Wilson, a Carroll scholar and a noted mathematics professor, has produced this revelatory book—filled with more than one hundred striking and often playful illustrations—that examines the many inspirations and sources for Carroll's fantastical writings, mathematical and otherwise. As Wilson demonstrates, Carroll—who published serious, if occasionally eccentric, works in the fields of geometry, logic, and algebra—made significant contributions to subjects as varied as voting patterns and the design of tennis tournaments, in the process creating imaginative recreational puzzles based on mathematical ideas. In the tradition of Sylvia Nasar's <em>A Beautiful Mind</em> and Andrew Hodges's <em>Alan Turing</em>, this is an engaging look at the incredible genius of one of mathematics' and literature's most enigmatic minds.","Science / Physics / Mathematical & Computational","English","2014-07-20 23:03:59","3673893","2014-09-27 05:34:48","2014-09-14 23:15:10","6b0a639d56aa957c677149c99f5551c1",

He treats European witchcraft as a product of Christianity, grounded in heresy more than in the magic and sorcery that have existed in other societies. Skillfully blending narration with analysis, he shows how social and religious changes nourished the spread of witchcraft until large portions of medieval Europe were in its grip—""from the most illiterate peasant to the most skilled philosopher or scientist.""A significant chapter in the history of ideas and their repression is illuminated by this book. Our growing fascination with the occult gives the author's affirmation that witchcraft arises at times and in areas afflicted with social tensions a special quality of immediacy.","Travel / Europe / General","English","2014-07-20 23:06:00","4962649","2014-09-27 05:34:53","2014-09-14 23:15:13","2985269e8b3dbefd2622c5db660a427f",

ABSTRACT <P>Skeletal remains of an archaic man were found in the Great Basin of the United States.  Radiocarbon date is 3500 years.  Distinguishing features include protruding brows unlike those of any other hominid species, archaic or modern.  The skull is broad based and the posterior view differs from that of modern man.  Presented are 18 photographs of skull parts, 7 photographs of body and extremity bones, and 69 photographs of paleolithic artifacts.  The claim is well supported that this is a newly reported species, and it is given the name Homo americanus. <P>It is proposed that this archaic species made and used the paleolithic artifacts found in huge numbers in the region.  Appendixes I and II add parts of the author's books, Earliest Man of America in Oregon, U.S.A.; with photographs of paleolithic artifacts, and Originations of Life from Volcanoes and Petroleum.  Some paleolithic tools are claimed to be 3-4 million years old.  The author bases his theory of multiple originations of life on fundamentals of geology, physics, chemistry, biology, and observations of plants and animals.  The presented archaic man found in North America provides additional support for that theory.  CONSISTENT RECENT REPORT <P>Amy Dansie, an anthropologist at the Nevada State Museum reported 10,000 hours studying 550 burials excavated prior to 1900 in the Great Basin in Nevada, including five over 9000 years old.

The Rosetta Stone was to become one of the most famous Egyptian antiquities in the world as well as an instantly recognizable icon of script and decipherment. In this exciting, beautifully illustrated work, Richard Parkinson tells the story of the Stone's discovery and the so-called battle of the decipherers that it inspired. Published to accompany a major exhibition at the British Museum celebrating the bicentenary of the Stone's discovery, and including a selective catalog of the exhibits, this book also examines the wider issues of script and writing in ancient Egypt and beyond.<br>The Rosetta Stone is a fragment of a stela inscribed with a priestly decree in honor of Ptolemy V. The main significance of the text lies not in its content, however, but in the fact that it is written in three scripts--hieroglyphic, demotic, and ancient Greek. Early Orientalists recognized immediately the potential of the Stone for the decipherment of Egyptian hieroglyphs. Thomas Young made great advances, especially with the demotic text, but it was Jean-François Champollion who made the final breakthrough in 1822. In so doing he cracked much more than two Egyptian scripts: He opened up Egyptian culture as a whole to historians.<br>Among the subjects discussed in <em>Cracking Codes</em> are the relationship between hieroglyphs and art, the social prestige of literacy, and the power of writing and its practical aspects (scribal equipment and training). A brief description of other decipherments is also given, drawing on examples such as Linear B and Meroitic--a language which remains to be read.<br><em>A selection of the History Book Club, the Book-of-the-Month Club, and the Quality Paperback Book Club</em>","History / General","English","2014-07-28 05:12:24","745031","2014-09-27 05:38:26","2014-09-14 23:17:04","24bf84e53604a81b1bae359825a630d0",

Questions about the artist’s use of symbols, his preoccupation with man’s sinfulness and hell, and even details about the Bosch’s own life have been the source of speculation and frustration. Wilhelm Fraenger’s masterwork, the culmination of twenty years of meticulous research and scholarly detective work, reveals his fascinating discoveries about Bosch’s patrons and the secular and religious climate in which he painted. This classic monograph available for the first time from Prestel looks beyond the bizarre nature of Bosch’s images to decipher their true meanings and purpose. Written in an eminently readable and entertaining style, and illustrated with more than more than two hundred reproductions, the book invites readers to enter the painter’s phantasmagoric universe, and deepens their understanding of this often misunderstood artist.","","English","2014-09-15 19:16:37","2025725","2014-09-27 05:43:33","2014-09-15 19:16:37","98b3f3dbe4a14259506745e7bfbb6e5c",

Composed toward the end of the first millennium, Beowulf is the classic Northern epic of a hero’s triumphs as a young warrior and his fated death as a defender of his people. The poem is about encountering the monstrous, defeating it, and then having to live on, physically and psychically exposed in the exhausted aftermath. It is not hard to draw parallels in this story to the historical curve of consciousness in the twentieth century, but the poem also transcends such considerations, telling us psychological and spiritual truths that are permanent and liberating.<br><br><br><strong>Who's Afraid of Beowulf?</strong><br>Seamus Heaney, recipient of the Nobel Prize in Literature and considered by many to be the greatest living poet writing in English, has produced a new work that will be one of the most significant literary events of the year. This meditation on fame, blood feuds, and the culture of war, already awarded the Whitbread Prize for poetry and named the Whitbread Book of the Year, addresses some of the most important issues of our world at the turn of the millennium. The trouble is, it was written in the <em>first</em> millennium, more than a thousand years ago: Heaney's latest offering is not a collection of original poems or essays, but a modern English verse translation of that greatest of heroic epics, <em>Beowulf</em>.<br><br>Heaney's project is to save <em>Beowulf</em> and what he calls its status as a work of ""the greatest imaginative vitality"" from the tedium of required English courses in high schools and universities. Because of its arcane language, this gripping and beautifully wrought story is largely impenetrable to modern audiences. What's more, just as <em>Beowulf</em>'s language and structure paved the way for modern English and its literary devices, its themes of fame and warrior cultures can tell us a lot about the world we now inhabit, where fame is viewed as perhaps the only thing worth achieving, and intractable ethnic conflicts wreak havoc on humankind. Some things never change -- or, as Heaney puts it, BEOWULF ""lives in its own continuous present, equal to our knowledge of reality in the present time.""<br><br>The tale is simple, and yet complex in its telling. It is composed of three main sections that center on a mortal battle: Beowulf's fight with Grendel the monster in the hall of a Danish king; his underwater battle with Grendel's mother, who is bent on revenge; and, finally, 50 years later, Beowulf's death at the hands of a third monster, a dragon accidentally awakened in Beowulf's own kingdom. Each sequence, narrated by an anonymous speaker who is familiar with the customs and laws of the Scandinavian people who make up the epic's characters, follows a similar pattern. First, there is a suspense-producing  buildup in which the monster makes its presence known and begins its rampage; then, Beowulf's arrival on the scene and the ensuing battle to the death; and lastly a taking of stock -- in the first two cases, a celebration of the monster's defeat, and in the final sequence, in which the dragon is killed at the cost of Beowulf's life, a period of mourning. Interwoven with these main tales are many diversionary stories, and a series of pronouncements that define the role of the hero and the ethics of war, friendship, and death.<br><br>As in Homer, certain powerful phrases and titles, such as ""Hrothgar the ring-giver,"" recur throughout the epic, lending it a comforting and rhythmic certainty. Heaney has divined an odd and mannered lyricism in the Old English and reproduced it in a fresh and compelling way in our own familiar tongue. In his introduction, Heaney speaks of the respect he had as a child for the plain and solemn voices of his father's Northern Irish relatives and how he wanted his translation ""to be speakable by one of those relatives."" It is filled with simple and direct turns of phrase, such as the final sentence of a list of the virtues of Shield Sheafson, a Danish warrior-king: ""That was one good king."" <br><br>Heaney's next accomplishment is that he remains faithful to <em>Beowulf</em>'s confusing structure without losing the thread of the story. The main narrator often gives way to speeches by his characters, who will tell similar (but unrelated) stories of other great warriors. Through these digressions the setting develops, as do its surrounding ethical framework and dramatizing rituals, lending a deeper symbolic meaning to the archetypal actions of its great hero. Poets and bards occasionally appear to sing of more heroic deeds, and, in another instance of this ancient tale's surprising relevance for modern readers, the speaker argues for the descriptive powers of these poets in a self-referential manner that seems positively postmodern.<br><br>Heaney has provided a rich and original translation of <em>Beowulf</em> that should dispel once and for all the ""rumor"" that it is a boring, repetitive tale filled with unpronounceable names. His new offering is vivid and at times breathtaking; it renews the timeless drama of an often-misunderstood epic.<p>Jake Kreilkamp</p>","Poetry / Medieval","English","2014-09-15 19:17:28","52357","2014-09-27 05:43:38","2014-09-15 19:17:28","34f932b31dbaaa22d9ee2913a8892634",

Its mellow character and autumnal tone have long made it a favorite with Austen readers. Set in Somersetshire and Bath, the novel revolves around the lives and love affair of Sir Walter Elliot, his daughters Elizabeth, Anne, and Mary, and various in-laws, friends, suitors, and other characters, In Anne Elliot, the author created perhaps her sweetest, most appealing heroine.<br>At the center of the novel is Anne's thwarted romance with Captain Frederick Wentworth, a navy man Anne met and fell in love with when she was 19. At the time, Wentworth was deemed an unsuitable match and Anne was forced to break off the relationship. Eight years later, however, they meet again. By this time Captain Wentworth has made his fortune in the navy and is an attractive ""catch."" However, Anne is now uncertain about his feelings for her. But after various twists and turns of fortune, the novel ends on a happy note.<br>In <em>Persuasion</em>, as in such novels as <em>Sense and Sensibility</em>, <em>Pride and Prejudice</em>, and <em>Emma</em>, Austen limned the plight of young women who could escape the constraints of family life only by marrying, and suggest the foolishness of women who believed they were free and not dependent on the financial and social resources of men. At the same time, <em>Persuasion</em> offers an ironic and subtle paean to the true love that enables one woman to rise above straitened economic circumstances and the stifling social conventions that restricted women to narrowly circumscribed lives in the common sitting room.<br>Sure to appeal to admirers of Jane Austen, <em>Persuasion</em> will delight any reader with its finely drawn characters, gentle satire, and charming re-creation of the genteel world of the 19th-century English countryside.","Fiction / Classics","English","2014-09-18 04:17:49","0","0000-00-00","2014-09-18 04:17:49","6f3a29cba3476fe5a071cdf0167694d1",

In Female Masculinity Judith Halberstam takes aim at the protected status of male masculinity and shows that female masculinity has offered a distinct alternative to it for well over two hundred years. Providing the first full-length study on this subject, Halberstam catalogs the diversity of gender expressions among masculine women from nineteenth-century pre-lesbian practices to contemporary drag king performances.<p>Through detailed textual readings as well as empirical research, Halberstam uncovers a hidden history of female masculinities while arguing for a more nuanced understanding of gender categories that would incorporate rather than pathologize them. She rereads Anne Lister's diaries and Radclyffe Hall's The Well of Loneliness as foundational assertions of female masculine identity. She considers the enigma of the stone butch and the politics surrounding butch/femme roles within lesbian communities. She also explores issues of transsexuality among ""transgender dykes""---lesbians who pass as men---and female-to-male transsexuals who may find the label of ""lesbian"" a temporary refuge. Halberstam also tackles such topics as women and boxing, butches in Hollywood and independent cinema, and the phenomenon of male impersonators.</p><p>Female Masculinity signals a new understanding of masculine behaviors and identities, and a new direction in interdisciplinary queer scholarship. Illustrated with nearly forty photographs, including portraits, film stills, and drag king performance shots, this book provides an extensive record of the wide range of female masculinities. And as Halberstam clearly demonstrates, female masculinity is not some bad imitation of virility, but a lively and dramatic staging of hybrid and minority genders.</p>","Social Science / Gender Studies","English","2014-10-02 15:39:36","0","0000-00-00","2014-10-02 15:39:36","f5a5af4f8e7d1607052c0792ca4e54b7",

Written in the  eleventh century, <em>The Tale of Genji</em> is widely celebrated as the world's  first novel, but as Donald Keene has observed, it is also ""one of its greatest.""  Genji the Shining Prince, the son of an emperor, is a passionate character whose  tempestuous nature, family circumstances, love affairs, alliances, and shifting  political fortunes form the core of this magnificent epic. Throughout, <em>The  Tale of Genji</em> offers a lively and well-rounded glimpse of golden age Japan  with a cast of characters as richly conceived and nuanced as those of Proust. <s>Royall Tyler's superb translation, detailed and poetic, is scrupulously true to  the Japanese original but appeals immediately to the modern reader as well.  Tyler includes detailed notes, glossaries, character lists, and chronologies to  help the reader navigate the multigenerational narrative and its references. </s> Magnificently packaged in a two-volume set with a slipcase, this is a literary  event comparable to Seamus Heaney's bestselling translation of <em>Beowulf</em>.  It will spark interest in this masterpiece of world literature and serve as the  standard edition for many years to come.<br><br> Translated by <s>Royall Tyler</s> Edward G. Seidensticker .","","English","2014-10-19 01:24:51","0","0000-00-00","2014-10-19 01:24:51","45645e2bda2245087934a9682157af30",
